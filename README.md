X Education, an online education company specializing in selling courses to industry
professionals, is facing a challenge with its lead conversion rate, which currently stands
at 30%. Despite generating a substantial number of leads through various channels like
website visitors, form submissions, and referrals, the company is determined to enhance
its conversion rate to meet the CEO's ambitious target of 80%.
To address this issue, X Education is seeking the development of a lead scoring model.
This model will evaluate each lead and assign a score based on the probability of
conversion. The primary objective is to identify and prioritize "Hot Leads," representing
potential customers with a higher likelihood of converting into paying clients.
By implementing an effective lead scoring system, X Education aims to empower its
sales team to focus their efforts on the leads with the greatest potential for conversion.
This strategic approach will involve nurturing and engaging with these high-scoring
leads, increasing the likelihood of successfully converting them into satisfied customers
and ultimately achieving the targeted 80% lead conversion rate.
Objective of Case Study:
Develop a logistic regression model to assign lead scores between 0 and 100, identifying
and prioritizing "Hot Leads" with a higher probability of conversion.
There are some more problems presented by the company which your model should be
able to adjust to if the company's requirement changes in the future so you will need to
handle these as well. These problems are provided in a separate doc file. Please fill it
based on the logistic regression model you got in the first step. Also, make sure you
include this in your final PPT where you'll make recommendations.
Conclusion:
The logistic regression model analysis yields valuable insights for optimizing lead
generation efforts and enhancing conversion rates. Key findings include the importance
of features such as 'Lead Origin_Lead Add Form,' 'Current_Occupation_Working
Professional,' and 'Total Time Spent on Website,' which exhibit high conversion rates
and should be prioritized in lead generation strategies. Targeting working professionals
is recommended due to their higher probability of conversion and potentially better
financial situations.
